NAME
    App::ppisel - Select PPI::Element nodes using CSel syntax

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of App::ppisel (from Perl
    distribution App-ppisel), released on 2019-07-29.

SYNOPSIS
FUNCTIONS
  ppisel
    Usage:

     ppisel(%args) -> [status, msg, payload, meta]

    Select PPI::Element nodes using CSel syntax.

    This function is not exported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   expr => *str*

    *   file => *str* (default: "-")

    *   node_actions => *array[str]* (default: ["print_as_string"])

        Specify action(s) to perform on matching nodes.

        Each action can be one of the following:

        *   "count" will print the number of matching nodes.

        *   "print_method" will call on or more of the node object's methods
            and print the result. Example:

            print_method:as_string

        *   "dump" will show a indented text representation of the node and
            its descendants. Each line will print information about a single
            node: its class, followed by the value of one or more
            attributes. You can specify which attributes to use in a
            dot-separated syntax, e.g.:

            dump:tag.id.class

        which will result in a node printed like this:

         HTML::Element tag=p id=undef class=undef

        By default, if no attributes are specified, "id" is used. If the
        node class does not support the attribute, or if the value of the
        attribute is undef, then "undef" is shown.

    *   select_action => *str* (default: "csel")

        Specify how we should select nodes.

        The default is "csel", which will select nodes from the tree using
        the CSel expression. Note that the root node itself is not included.
        For more details on CSel expression, refer to Data::CSel.

        "root" will return a single node which is the root node.

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (payload) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

    Return value: (any)
